# Fairness in Recommendation Systems with GNN's

Applying a few algorithms (ALS, NeuMF, LightGCN and KGAT) to a few datasets (Amazon Book, LastFM, Yelp, MovieLens)

Comparing fairness across multiple metrics - accuracy (NDCG, Hitrate, Precision, Recall, F1) and beyond-accuracy (Novelty, Diversity, Coverage)

Fairness is computed for each algorithm between user and item groups (high-user vs. low-user activty) and (high-item vs. low-item activity)

Understanding how fair each algorithm is and asking what benefits do GNN's bring?
